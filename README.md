# GAT-for-biodegradation

Using Graph Attention Network to explore the impact of chemical structure to biodegradation.

**How to use?**

For using GNN to predict  chemical biodegradation, you need translate chemicals to graph by RDKit and Graph Nerual Library.  The following packages are the major for this research.

RDKit: https://www.rdkit.org/docs/Install.html

DGL: https://www.dgl.ai/

DGL-Lifesci: https://lifesci.dgl.ai/

PyTorch: https://pytorch.org/

You can simply use ''environment.yaml'' to create a special environment to run code file by conda.
